      -> routing to other pages using the InkWell method
            -> first we need to define static keyword for the varible
                -> static varible need not want the intialization
                -> it can be directly accesed using ClassName.variable/ fuction
                ->code for this
                     static  const routeName = '/OnsaleScreen';
            -> we simply intialise the routename = '/classname' as a constant
         -> we need to declare the routes in the materialApp in the main.dart file
            routes is the dictoinory that maps string to widgets
                   -> code for this
                             routes: {
                                 OnsaleScreen.routeName : (context) => OnsaleScreen(),
                                     },
         ->   for routing to next page we have Inkwell consists of method
                    onTap: (){
                           Navigator.PushedName(context,className.routeName//const variable in class);
                    }
                    code for this
                        TextButton(onPressed: (){
                                      GlobalVariable.routeTo(context: context, routeName: OnsaleScreen.routeName);
                                    }, child: Text("View All",style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20,color: Colors.blue),)),
          -> we created the global variable to route the pages dynamically for code reuseability
                ->static routeTo({required BuildContext context,required String routeName}){
                      Navigator.pushNamed(context, routeName);
                    }
                -> note: here the static keyword to access the method without intialiaing
                    eg: className.method/variable;
